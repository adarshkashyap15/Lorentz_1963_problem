# Lorenz 1963 problem solver
The Lorenz 1963 problem refers to a seminal paper published by Edward Lorenz in 1963 titled "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow."
The Lorenz equations are a set of three differential equations that model the behavior of a simplified atmospheric convection system. They were designed to capture the essential dynamics of weather patterns. When these equations are solved numerically, they produce a pattern of solutions that is known as the Lorenz attractor. This attractor has a characteristic butterfly-like shape.

## MATLAB Instructions
This project is done in MATLAB. So it is a must to install MATLAB or use it online.  
You can install it using the link [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

## Main Code
There are two MATLAB files. The first file is main code that will give you butterfly like shape with video and second code is the MATLAB live script of the same code. MATLAB live script is an interactive way to present your code. It is just like Jupyter notebook for python where we can run codes in different cell with output of each cell presented alonside.

## Functions
There are three MATLAB files. These files are functions which are called in the main code. In MATLAB we can make functions in different file and then call them in the main code.
