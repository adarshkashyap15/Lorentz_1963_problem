# Lorentz 1963 problem solver
The Lorenz 1963 problem refers to a seminal paper published by Edward Lorenz in 1963 titled "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow."
The Lorenz equations are a set of three differential equations that model the behavior of a simplified atmospheric convection system. They were designed to capture the essential dynamics of weather patterns. When these equations are solved numerically, they produce a pattern of solutions that is known as the Lorenz attractor. This attractor has a characteristic butterfly-like shape.
